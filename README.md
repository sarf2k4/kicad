# kicad footprint
kicad pcb footprint

These are some of the kicad's footprint that will be used mainly for kicad's pcbnew module. 

Not an electronic engineer so what I wanted to incorporate is to add an existing module for example footprints of an arduino module such as i2c module where you just have to solder onto your exisitng projects without the need of adding individual components to include to your own pcb
