# kicad footprint
kicad pcb footprint

These are some of the kicad's footprint that will be used mainly for kicad's pcbnew module. 

Not an electronic engineer so what I wanted to incorporate is to add an existing module for example footprints of an arduino module such as i2c module where you just have to solder onto your exisitng projects without the need of adding individual components to include to your own pcb
=======
schematics parts and PCB footprints for kicad of parts used in my projects create by me.

including:

S3860M-S bluetooth audio module based on OVC3860

MB-CM15113 bluetooth audio module

F-3188 CSR8645 based bluetooth 4.0 module

BLK-MD-SPK-B bluetooth audio module based on OVC3860

68HC05 motorola cpu
